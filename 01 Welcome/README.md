# Welcome ðŸŽ‰
Hi and welcome! It is good to see you here at this Xamarin workshop. My name is Robin-Manuel Thiel and I will guide you through the next hours of learning cool stuff.

In the following modules, you will learn a lot about the native cross-platform development with Xamarin, how to share code and even layouts effectively and create a clean architecture. We will also create simple backends in the cloud and connect it with the mobile applications.

Sounds good? Let us take a look at what you can expect!

## What you can expect
As promised before, we will create a native cross-platform application for the iOS, Android and Windows platform. You will learn what Xamarin is, how it works and what its characteristics are. You will be guided through the creation of Xamarin projects and the decision of where to place which code to maximize code-sharing. We will create a cloud backend in Microsoft Azure together and learn how to connect it easily with the frontend projects.

In the end, we will have a working iOS, Android and Windows application that follows several Xamarin concepts and cross-platform best practices.

## How to work with this workshop
You already did the first step into the right direction and found this Welcoming Module. That means that you might have already chosen a suitable workshop path for you.

Just work through the modules in the given order. You can also skip most modules, as they provide the finished code attached to them.
